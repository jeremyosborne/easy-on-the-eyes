# 0.0.2 (to be released)

* DEV: Break dependency on `html-to-markdown`. That project inspired this, but
  I realized it's not the same thing I want to do here, and also not efficient
  enough. That project was started so I could grab wikipedia articles and store
  them in text files on disk. This project is about reading in the browser without
  distractions, and converting to and from markdown is not what is needed.



# 0.0.1 (released 2016 Feb 07)

* Basic functionality as I work out exactly what I want this app to do, besides
  filter content heavy websites down into plain content.
